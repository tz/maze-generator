# maze-generator
Generate maze images

Use a depth-first search to create a maze. Use iteration to prevent a stack overflow that would come with recursion. The maze's appearance is configurable by changing the color and size options, as well as the "move_{direction}_weight" settings, which make different directions more likely to be selected.
